# assumptions before doing this following
# r0 contains x1
# r1 contains x2
# r3 contains y1
# r4 contains y2
# r12 contains 128
# r14 contains 0
# r15 contains overflow

## what we want
# r5 contains the absolute value of the difference between x1 and y1
# r6 contains the absolute value of the difference between x2 and y2
# r13 copy of overflow to use

# find difference of lower half
put 5
put 0
put 3
sub

# stores the value of overflow into r13
put 13
put 14
put 15
add


# store  (happens when x == -128, y=127)

put 6
